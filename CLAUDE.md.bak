# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a website project for Kristi Hemmer. Currently, the repository contains only static assets in the `public/` directory.

## Assets Structure

- `public/images/`: Brand graphic elements in multiple color variants (Black, White, Pink, LightPink, Red, Yellow), gradients, header images, and thumbnails
- `public/logos/`: Branding logos including favicon, pink logo variants, and logo animation video
- `public/video/`: Video thumbnails

## Brand Colors

Based on asset filenames, the brand uses:
- Fearless Fuchsia (primary pink)
- Sunny Yellow
- Black
- White
- Red accents

## Development Notes

This repository currently lacks:
- Build configuration (package.json, etc.)
- Source code files
- Framework setup

When initializing the codebase, consider the existing brand assets and color scheme in the design implementation.
